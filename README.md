Let me introduce you the main differences between the Transparent Proxy Model and UUPS Proxy Model.

1.Upgrade Mechanism Location

In the Transparent Proxy Model, the upgrade mechanism is external to the implementation contract and managed through a separate admin contract. 
However, UUPS model integrates the upgrade mechanism within the implementation contract itself.

2.Administration

Transparent Proxy requires a clear separation between administrative actions and regular contract interactions. It is enforced by checking the caller's address. 
But UUPS model does not require such separation at the proxy level.This is because the upgrade logic is part of the implementation.

3.Gas Efficiency

UUPS is generally more gas-efficient for upgrades because it does not require the additional overhead of external admin checks and logic.

4.Security and Complexity

The UUPS model can be more complex to implement securely since the implementation contract must handle upgrade logic. It will increase the risk of vulnerabilities if it is not done correctly. 
Transparent Proxy Model simplifies security concerns by separating administrative functions but at the cost of increased gas for admin actions.
