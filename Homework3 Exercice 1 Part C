The main difference between these two methods is how they manage and pay for the fees associated with generating random numbers.



Subscription method: 
Users or projects obtain the right to use VRF services within a period of time or a certain number of requests by paying a certain subscription fee. 
This method is suitable for applications that frequently require random numbers, such as online games, lottery systems, etc., 
because it can reduce the cost of each request and improve economic efficiency.



Direct funding method: 
Each time a random number is requested, the user or project needs to pay the corresponding fee directly. 
This method is suitable for scenarios that occasionally require random number services, 
such as specific smart contract operations or a small number of random number generation needs, because it does not require a large upfront fee and is more flexible.
